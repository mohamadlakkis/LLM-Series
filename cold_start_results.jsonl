The TV costs $600 and the fridge costs $500 more than the computer. How much does the computer cost?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>First, the total budget is $1600. Mustafa buys a fridge, a TV, and a computer. The TV costs $600. So, I need to find out how much the computer costs.\n\nLet me denote the cost of the computer as C dollars. Then, according to the problem, the fridge costs $500 more than the computer. So, the cost of the fridge is C + 500.\n\nNow, the total cost is the sum of all three items: fridge + TV + computer = total budget.\n\nSo, (C + 500) + 600 + C = 1600\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nFridge cost: C + 500\n\nTV cost: 600\n\nComputer cost: C\n\nTotal: (C + 500) + 600 + C = 1600\n\nNow, simplify this equation:\n\nCombine like terms: C + C + 500 + 600 = 1600\n\nSo, 2C + 1100 = 1600\n\nNow, subtract 1100 from both sides to isolate the term with C:\n\n2C + 1100 - 1100 = 1600 - 1100\n\n2C = 500\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nC = 500 / 2\n\nC = 250\n\nSo, the computer costs $250.\n\nNow, let me verify this. If computer is $250, then fridge is $250 + $500 = $750. TV is $600. Total: $750 + $600 + $250 = $1600. Yes, that matches the total budget.\n\nTherefore, the computer costs $250.</think>\nLet the cost of the computer be \\( C \\) dollars.  \nThe fridge costs $500 more than the computer, so the fridge costs \\( C + 500 \\) dollars.  \nThe TV costs $600.  \nThe total cost is given as $1600, so:  \n\\[ (C + 500) + 600 + C = 1600 \\]  \nSimplify the equation:  \n\\[ 2C + 1100 = 1600 \\]  \nSubtract 1100 from both sides:  \n\\[ 2C = 500 \\]  \nDivide both sides by 2:  \n\\[ C = 250 \\]  \nThus, the computer costs $250.  \n\nVerification:  \nFridge: \\( 250 + 500 = 750 \\)  \nTV: 600  \nComputer: 250  \nTotal: \\( 750 + 600 + 250 = 1600 \\), which matches the budget.  \n\n#### <answer>  \n250  \n</answer>"}]}

Jaco bought a pair of shoes for $74; 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair; a bag that costs $42. How much will Jaco pay for those items?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>First, I need to calculate Jaco's total charge before any discount. He bought:\n\n- A pair of shoes for $74\n\n- 2 pairs of socks that cost $2 per pair, so that's 2 * $2 = $4\n\n- A bag that costs $42\n\nSo, total charge = $74 + $4 + $42\n\nLet me add that up: 74 + 4 = 78, and 78 + 42 = 120. So, total charge is $120.\n\nNow, the discount is 10% for the amount exceeding $100. So, the amount exceeding $100 is $120 - $100 = $20.\n\nThe discount is 10% of this $20, so discount = 10% of $20 = 0.10 * 20 = $2.\n\nTherefore, Jaco will pay the total charge minus the discount: $120 - $2 = $118.\n\nI should double-check. The discount is only on the amount over $100, so yes, he pays full price for the first $100, and then 10% off on the excess. So, he pays $100 + (100% - 10%) of $20 = $100 + 90% of $20 = $100 + 0.90 * 20 = $100 + $18 = $118. Same answer.\n\nSo, Jaco will pay $118.</think>\nJaco's total charge is calculated by adding the cost of all items:  \n- Shoes: $74  \n- Socks: 2 pairs \u00d7 $2 per pair = $4  \n- Bag: $42  \nTotal charge = $74 + $4 + $42 = $120  \n\nThe discount applies only to the amount exceeding $100. The amount exceeding $100 is $120 - $100 = $20.  \nThe discount is 10% of $20, so discount = 0.10 \u00d7 $20 = $2.  \n\nTherefore, Jaco pays the total charge minus the discount: $120 - $2 = $118.  \n\n#### <answer>\n118\n</answer>"}]}
